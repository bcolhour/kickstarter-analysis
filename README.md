## Summary of Findings
<b> US </b> <br>

- Of the successful theater campaigns, the mean number of days the campaign ran was 29.<br>
- Many of the campaigns missed their goal amount by a small margin, with the months of May and June both having a greater success rate.<br>
- The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. <br>

<b> US </b> <br>
You are asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal. It is recommended to reduce the goal in order to increase chances of a successful kickstarter. 
  - You may want to consider splitting into 2 campaigns based on different phases.
  - It is ideal to launch in May with a 30 day campaign. 
  
  
  <b> Great Britain </b> - <BR>
While theater shows good results in Great Britain, with half of the goals being £2,000 , you should probably try to get your play produced for less than £4,000 for increased probability of a successful campaign.<br><br>
